# Dev environments

## Mac

This repository contains my **MacOS** environment configuration.

I am using yabai as my window manager.

Neovim as my editor.

Skhd as my hotkey daemon.

## Linux

In the future I will be posting my linux environments too.
Even though the Neovim one would be very similar.
