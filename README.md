# Dev environments

## Mac

This repository contains my **MacOS** environment configuration.

I am using yabai as my window manager.

Neovim as my editor.

Skhd as my hotkey daemon.

## Linux

Neovim configuration for linus has a couple different installs but most of it should work.

- Need to install black.
- Need to install a nerd font.

Added my Tmux configuration.
